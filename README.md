# HLGST-Hybrid-Local-Global-Spatio-Temporal-Model-for-Travel-Time-Estimation-Using-Siamese-Graph-Conv
A novel deep-learning framework named "Hybrid Local-Global Spatio-Temporal (HLGST) Model for Travel Time Estimation Using Siamese Graph Convolutional with Triplet Networks". It can consider both local and global spatial-temporal correlations between traffic nodes in order to improve the accuracy of TTE results.
